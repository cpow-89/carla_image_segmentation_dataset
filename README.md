# Dataset for image segmentation

This dataset was created by using the [Carla Simulator](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) simulator. 
If you are interested in creating your own image segmentation dataset using carla you can find full documentation and the code I used on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/cpow-89/carla_image_segmentation).
